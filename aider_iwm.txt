Focus: Type system documentation and strategy

I am maintaining knowledge about the Leaflet-Glify library, a WebGL rendering extension for Leaflet maps.
This document captures key architectural decisions, recent developments, and strategic direction.

Here are the key points I've learned and recent developments:

1 Core Architecture:
[Previous points remain valid, architecture is stable]

2 Recent Improvements:
[Previous improvements remain, plus:]
• Properly configured types exposure in package.json
• Enhanced documentation in type definitions
• Verified consistency between auto-generated and manual types

3 Type System Deep Dive:

• Manual types (leaflet-glify.d.ts):
  - Properly namespaced under leaflet.glify
  - Focuses on public API surface
  - Includes well-documented interfaces
  - Handles Leaflet namespace augmentation correctly

• Auto-generated types:
  - More granular and implementation-focused
  - Useful for internal development
  - Properly reflect actual code structure

• Type Strategy:
  - Manual types chosen for public API
  - Maintains clean separation between public/internal interfaces
  - Enhanced documentation for shape settings
  - Proper exposure through package.json types field

4 Key Components:
[Previous components remain valid]

5 Performance Considerations:
[Previous considerations remain valid]

The library follows a pattern where each layer type:
[Previous patterns remain valid]

Current focus areas:

• Type system refinement:
  - Maintaining manual/auto-generated type harmony
  - Ensuring proper public API exposure
  - Enhancing type documentation
  - Verifying type consistency

Next steps involve:

• Continue monitoring type system effectiveness
• Watch for any inconsistencies between implementation and type definitions
• Consider adding more specific type tests
• Look for opportunities to enhance type documentation further

Remember: 
• The library bridges Leaflet's map system with WebGL rendering
• Type definitions are crucial for public API stability
• Manual types in src/types/leaflet-glify.d.ts are the source of truth for public API
